## Optimized House Price Prediction Model for Bangalore
This project involves developing an enhanced house price prediction model using the Bengaluru House Data. By incorporating additional features and optimizing various machine learning models, the project aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of price predictions for properties in Bangalore.

# Key Features
- **Data Processing and Cleaning**: Processed and cleaned the Bengaluru House Data, including handling missing values, feature engineering, and outlier removal.
- **Dimensionality Reduction and Model Optimization**: Conducted dimensionality reduction and optimized model performance using GridSearchCV with linear, ridge, and lasso regression models.
- **Incorporating Additional Features**: Improved model accuracy from 0.84 to 0.87 by incorporating additional features such as area type and balcony
- **Model Selection**: Compared model performance metrics and selected the best model based on cross-validation results.
